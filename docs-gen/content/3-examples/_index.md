Below are some examples of how the Simplified Semantic Data Modeling (`S2DM`) approach can be applied in different areas or use cases. Each example is linked to its corresponding folder in the repository for further exploration.

## Example Use Cases

- [Multiple Classification Schemes](https://github.com/COVESA/s2dm/tree/main/examples/multiple-classification-schemes): Enabling multiple classification schemes using SKOS.
- [Multiple Domains](https://github.com/COVESA/s2dm/tree/main/examples/multiple-domains): Covering cross-references across different domains.
- [Seat Capabilities](https://github.com/COVESA/s2dm/tree/main/examples/seat-capabilities): Specifying possible operations linked to seat-related objects or entities.
- [Seat to VSS Mapping](https://github.com/COVESA/s2dm/tree/main/examples/seat-to-vspec): Mapping modular seat specifications to the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS).
- [Specification History Registry](https://github.com/COVESA/s2dm/tree/main/examples/spec-history-registry): Tracking changes and maintaining a registry of specification history.

## CLI Tool Examples

- [Version Bump CLI Examples](version-bump-cli): Demonstrating automated version bumping based on GraphQL schema changes using the `s2dm check version-bump` command.
