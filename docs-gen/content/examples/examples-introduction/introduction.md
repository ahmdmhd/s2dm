Below are some examples of how the Simplified Semantic Data Modeling (`S2DM`) approach can be applied in different areas or use cases. Each example provides comprehensive documentation and interactive visualizations to help you understand the modeling approaches.

## Use Cases

Explore real-world applications of S2DM across different domains:

- **[Seat Domain Model](seat-domain-model/)**: Modeling the `Seat` branch of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) with nested component hierarchies and rich type relationships.

- **[Trailer Domain Model](trailer-domain-model/)**: Modeling vehicle trailer systems including axles, wheels, and their specifications following automotive standards.

- **[Multiple Classification Schemes](multiple-classification-schemes/)**: Enabling flexible taxonomy management using SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) for cross-referencing classification systems.

- **[Multiple Domains](multiple-domains/)**: Handling cross-references across different domains while maintaining clear separation of concerns and modular architecture.

- **[Seat Capabilities](seat-capabilities/)**: Specifying operational capabilities and commands for seat-related entities, demonstrating capability-based design patterns.

- **[Specification History Registry](specification-history-registry/)**: Tracking changes and maintaining version history of specification evolution with automated change analysis.

## CLI Tool Examples

- [Version Bump CLI Examples](version-bump-cli): Demonstrating automated version bumping based on GraphQL schema changes using the `s2dm check version-bump` command.
