This example demonstrates how **S2DM** models the `Seat` branch of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). The domain model captures the complex relationships between seat components including backrest, headrest, seating surfaces, and their various capabilities.

## Overview

The seat domain model showcases:
- Nested component hierarchies (backrest, headrest, seating)
- Enumerated values for seat positions and capabilities
- Rich type relationships and data modeling
- Complex automotive domain relationships
