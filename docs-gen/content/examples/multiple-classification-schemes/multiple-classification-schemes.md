This example demonstrates how **S2DM** enables multiple classification schemes using **SKOS** (Simple Knowledge Organization System). The approach allows for flexible taxonomy management and cross-referencing between different classification systems.

## Overview

The multiple classification schemes example showcases:
- SKOS-based taxonomy management
- Cross-referencing between classification systems
- Flexible vocabulary organization
- Semantic relationships between concepts
